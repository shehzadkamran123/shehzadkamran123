I am Kamran Shehzad from Pakistan, looking forwad to become a senior web-developer and cybersecurity expert. I have started my journey with web-development and hopefully will end up achieving
my goals one day. I planning to move Germany on a Student Visa and claim my higher education there and exploit the German tech-Industry to gain hands-on experience and implement my innovative
ideas there.
